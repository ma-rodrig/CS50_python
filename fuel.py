# implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted
# as X/Y, wherein X is a non-negative integer and Y is a positive integer,
#  and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much
# fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to
# indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains,
# output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.
# If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
